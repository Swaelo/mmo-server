            //the world inertia tensor, this would save 6 scalar loads. In isolation, that's a likely win. However, there are some other considerations:
            //1) Some common constraints, notably including the contact constraints, do not load pose. They can either load diagonalized inertia with orientation (7 total scalars per body)
            //or a symmetric world inertia tensor (6 scalars). Given the relatively high cost of incoherent gathers, the 6 scalar world inertia gather would be used.
            //2) If constraints are loading from both local and world inertias rather than one or the other, the number of cache misses increases.
            //3) It requires that the local space of shapes is aligned with the moments of inertia. While this could be done automatically when creating shapes, and while
            //all primitive shapes are built with diagonal inertia tensors, it is likely that the local 'reorientation' required by diagonalization applied to things like
            //convex hulls or meshes would be confusing for users. Recentering certainly was in V1.
            //4) It cannot be used to save space on explicitly stored inertias in constraints, because the warmstart/solve do not load the pose (and, as above, loading orientation and
            //local inertia is 1 scalar more than just the world inertia).
            //5) While the local diagonal representation does offer some possibilities for ALU-level optimizations in the prestep, the effective mass matrix will be in world space,
            //and in general it will not be any smaller than the usual symmetric representation.
